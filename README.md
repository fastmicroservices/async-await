# async-await
JavaScript exercises on callbacks, promises, and async/await

## Description

* We start with an application that simulates a wait by using a busy loop. We change that into an asynchronous wait by means of callbacks.
* We take the callback-base version and turn it into promises.
* We take the promise-based version and turn it into async/await.

The exercises allows us to understand and compare the different ways of handling asynchronous subprograms in JavaScript.
